# Products Page - Refactored Architecture

## Overview

This products page has been refactored to use a **single file approach** with **Server Components** and minimal client-side hydration, following Next.js 13+ App Router best practices.

## Architecture

### File Structure

```
app/products/
├── page.tsx                    # Main Server Component (SSR/SSG)
├── loading.tsx                 # Loading UI
├── types.ts                    # Shared TypeScript interfaces
└── components/
    ├── product-grid.tsx        # Server Component for rendering products
    └── products-infinite-scroll.tsx  # Small Client Component for infinite scroll
```

### Key Principles

1. **Single File Approach**: Everything is in `page.tsx` unless absolutely necessary to separate
2. **Server Components First**: Static data fetching and layout handled server-side
3. **Minimal Client Hydration**: Only use `"use client"` for interactive features
4. **SEO Optimized**: Initial products rendered server-side for search engines
5. **Efficient Loading**: 4 products per page consistently

## Components

### `page.tsx` (Server Component)

- **Purpose**: Main page component with server-side data fetching
- **Features**:
  - Fetches initial 4 products server-side for SEO
  - Renders static layout and metadata
  - Uses Suspense for loading states

### `product-grid.tsx` (Server Component)

- **Purpose**: Renders the product grid
- **Features**:
  - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Handles price calculations
  - Responsive grid layout
  - No client-side interactivity

### `products-infinite-scroll.tsx` (Client Component)

- **Purpose**: Handles infinite scroll functionality
- **Features**:
  - Small, focused client component
  - Consistent page size (4 products per page)
  - Intersection Observer for efficient loading
  - Error handling and loading states

## Benefits

1. **Better SEO**: Initial products rendered server-side
2. **Faster Initial Load**: No client-side hydration for static content
3. **Smaller Bundle**: Minimal JavaScript sent to client
4. **Better Performance**: Server-side rendering with progressive enhancement
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

## Usage

The page automatically:

- Loads initial products server-side
- Renders them immediately for SEO
- Hydrates only the infinite scroll functionality
- Loads additional products as user scrolls

No additional configuration needed - just navigate to `/products`.
