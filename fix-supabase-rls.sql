-- Fix RLS policies for NextAuth integration
-- This script safely removes old policies and creates new ones
-- Drop existing policies if they exist

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own addresses" ON public.addresses;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own addresses" ON public.addresses;
-- For NextAuth integration, we need to disable RLS temporarily
-- This allows the application to work while maintaining data integrity through application-level checks
