# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - Test Data Setup

## Step 1: Get Your User ID

```sql
SELECT id, email FROM users LIMIT 1;
```

Copy the `id` value.

## Step 2: Replace in SQL File

Open `simple-test-orders.sql` (simplified version with only required fields) and replace all instances of:

- `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` with your actual user ID

**Note**: If you got a column error, use `simple-test-orders.sql` instead of `complete-test-orders.sql`

## Step 3: Execute SQL

Run the SQL file in Supabase SQL Editor or your database client.

## Step 4: Verify

```sql
SELECT
  order_number,
  total_amount,
  DATE(created_at) as date
FROM orders
WHERE order_number LIKE 'TEST-2024-10-%'
ORDER BY created_at;
```
